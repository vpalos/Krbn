# Roadmap

Detail, contracts, and the hard-parts registry live in [`ai/DESIGN.md`](ai/DESIGN.md).
This is the short view.

**Status legend:** ✅ done · 🚧 partial · ⬜ not started. Progress reflects the
tree as of 2026-07-05; see DESIGN.md §"Implementation status" for module-level
detail. Everything below is verified by `bun test` (unit + property + degeneracy
suites) and `bun run build`.

## Phase 1 — Analytic primitives (current)

Real-world value for technical figures, and the regime where the hardest module
(hidden-line visibility) is exact.

1. ✅ **Core math kernel** — `Vec3`/`Vec2`, `Basis`, `AABB`, `Camera` (ortho +
   perspective projection), `Ray`, and the `Curve`/`Curve2D` carriers, plus the
   **exact conic intersector** (line–conic; conic–conic via the pencil /
   degenerate-line-pair split) and robust real root solvers. The critical path,
   and the most heavily tested part of the engine. _(design.md §2.9.1)_
2. 🚧 **`FeatureSource` seam + `Scene` / element + importance model.** The
   interface exists and every primitive implements it directly. The `Scene`
   graph, element wrapper, and importance/role API _(design.md §2.8)_ are **not
   built yet** — primitives are currently constructed and queried standalone.
3. ✅ **Primitive catalog.** `Quadric` with exact silhouette conic (screen-space
   dual-quadric outline + object-space polar-plane contour), configured as
   `Sphere` / `Ellipsoid` / `Cylinder` / `Cone`; plus `Plane` / `Polygon`
   (occluder + hatch region), `Line`, and `ParametricCurve` (`Bézier`, `helix`,
   `functionPlot`). All expose closed-form `raycast` and `projectedSilhouettes`.
4. ✅ Stage 1 / emit / render: a runnable pass wires extract → visibility → emit
   → SVG (`renderScene` / `renderSceneSVG` in `src/pipeline/render.ts`). Verify by
   eye via `examples/demo.ts` → `examples/demo.svg`.
5. ✅ Stage 2: exact quantitative-invisibility → visible/hidden intervals.
   Analytic crossings (`projectedSilhouettes` × the feature's screen curve) place
   transversal boundaries exactly; each interval's state is an exact depth
   `raycast` toward the eye; grazing/cusp boundaries (tangencies) are caught by a
   sampled occlusion scan + bisection. `classifyScene` / `classifyFeature` in
   `src/pipeline/visibility.ts`.
6. ⬜ Intersection-curve features (sphere ∩ plane = circle, …). **← next**, with
   the `Scene` / importance model (step 2).
7. 🚧 Stage 4: styling (weight/dash/ghost/seeded-wobble) + hatch generation. Emit
   applies a minimal default policy (solid visible / faint-dashed hidden); the
   real styling stage, seeded wobble, and hatch generation are not built yet.
8. ⬜ Stage 3: abstraction (screen-size threshold, tone quantization, importance).
9. ✅ Stage 5: SVG backend (`src/backend/svg.ts`) with adaptive sampling of
   analytic curves at emit (`src/pipeline/emit.ts`, `curve/sample.ts`).

## Phase 2 — Mesh / organ regime (deferred, not lost)

One more `FeatureSource` implementation + the numerical machinery behind it;
everything from the stage-2 contract onward is reused. All ⬜.

1. Static scaffold — half-edge, normals, dihedral, crease/boundary tagging.
2. Curvature precompute (principal curvatures + derivative).
3. Silhouette as interpolated zero-set + chaining.
4. Suggestive contours.
5. Visibility — hybrid (depth-buffer-seeded) → fully analytic QI.
6. Temporal coherence for animation.

## Cross-cutting

Seeded/deterministic wobble ⬜, temporal-coherence discipline (starts in Phase 1)
⬜, SVG-first backend ✅ (`src/backend/svg.ts`), optional alpha as a pure drawing
op ⬜, and a declarative authoring language that later deserializes into the same
`Scene` model ⬜. The adaptive analytic-curve sampler this all leans on is ✅
(`curve/sample.ts`).
